        <h1>Welcome to C's Creations</h1>
        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Our main goal since day one is quality over qauntity and each bacth is hand made with the best ingredients.</p>

        <p>C's Creation has been around since 2017, when Cassidy and Calla opened a restaurant in Athlone. We then expanded with a move to the V&A Waterfront, where our popularity increased. Our sweet treats had people queuing for hours. </p>

        <p>We became known for our exciting and unusual cakes, but most of all, our belief in saying YES to whatever we could.No task was too much!</p>

        <p>The real magic of C's Creations lies in our philosophy of giving.
            We continually invest in uplifting our staff, most of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds and have no formal training. This has helped us to create our beautiful Rainbow Bakery Family.</p>

            <p>Our dream is much more than having a successful business, it is to inspire others to add a bit more sweetness to the lives of their families and communities, and to be the change they wish to see in the world.</p>
